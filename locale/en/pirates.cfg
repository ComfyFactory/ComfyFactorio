softmod_info_game_description_2=Set sail in this multiplayer scenario. Collect resources and fuel the ship in order to survive as many leagues as possible. The ship moves with code magic.

softmod_info_tips_1=Features of the game that are hard to work out alone
softmod_info_tips_2=• You can steer the boat from the crow's nest by placing 100 rail signals in one of the blue boxes.\n• Resources granted to the ship appear in the captain's cabin.\n• Charging a silo launches a rocket. This causes pollution and evo, but gives a reward of fuel and doubloons.\n• Charging a silo drains power from everything else on its network.\n• The quantity of ore available on an island is independent of the order in which you break rocks.\n• Passive pollution ramps up over time on each island.\n• The strength of attacks is proportional to the number of remaining nests. (The time-based rate of evolution is proportional to nests too, but destroying a nest will immediately jump evolution by most of the amount it 'would have' made had it survived.)\n• Covered markets give back any plates spent to unlock them.\n• Lab productivity increases with each league.\n• The player who spent the longest as captain between leagues 0 and 1000 (exclusive) is written into the highscores table.\n• Logged-out players keep their items with them for a while — except 'important' items that are returned to the crew immediately.\n• Commands: /ccolor gives you a fun color. /classinfo {classname} gives the description of the named class. To manage your class, use /take {classname} or /giveup. Captains also have /undock, /req, /officer, /plank.
