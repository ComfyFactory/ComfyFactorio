softmod_info_game_description_1=Game Description
softmod_info_game_description_2=Set sail with a crew of teammates. Collect resources and fuel the ship in order to survive as many leagues as possible. Each crew has a captain, who performs actions such as deciding when the boat leaves. Doubloons can be spent at various markets throughout the game. Game progression is slower for smaller crews. Mysteries await!\n\n[font=default-bold]Win condition:[/font] Travel 1000 leagues.\n[font=default-bold]Lose condition:[/font] The ship runs out of fuel, or a cannon is destroyed.

softmod_info_tips_1=Features of the game that are hard to work out alone
softmod_info_tips_2=• The captain (or officers) can steer the boat from the crow's nest by placing 50 rail signals in one of the blue boxes.\n• The quantity on an island is independent of the order in which you break rocks.\n• Passive pollution ramps up over time on each island.\n• Items dropped on the deck are transferred to the cabin when the boat moves for performance reasons.\n• Mining productivity increases naturally with leagues traveled.\nOn multiplayer, crews that are inactive for 96 hours are auto-disbanded.\n• Useful commands: /classinfo {classname} command, /plank {player}, /officer {player}, /undock, /ccolor, /clear_north_tanks, /clear_south_tanks, /tax, /reset_password

softmod_info_1_1=v1.6.7

softmod_info_2_1=v1.6.1–1.6.6 highlights
softmod_info_2_2=• Optional setting for new crews to disable blueprints.\n• Each island now has a grace period of 2 minutes before attacks.\n• Machines now deactivate after several minutes spent waiting at sea.\n• Private crews and captain-protected crews no longer revert to public crews when inactive. Runs now autodisband after 96 hours of inactivity.\n• Further slowing of gameplay for small crews.

softmod_info_3_1=v1.6.0 highlights
softmod_info_3_2=• 7 simultaneous crews supported. Surface loading is paused if other crews are engaged in a fight at sea, or are loading themselves.\n• New runs begin on the top lane so that beginners are more likely to encounter docks.\n• Disconnecting players once again have their items temporarily saved. Items are returned to the crew if players don't reconnect quickly.\n• Players now die rather than being temporarily marooned if they miss the boat.\n• Melee classes can no longer hold weapons. New class added.\n• The pause at sea now occurs after the loading time for the next destination.
